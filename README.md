The data in this repository is linked to the following report https://doi.org/10.25561/77295, and the resulting estimate of the prevalence in repatriated citizens was used as a ball park estimate of the infection prevalence in the general population of Wuhan, in the absence of reliable surveys early on in the pandemic in the publication "Estimates of the severity of coronavirus disease 2019: a model-based analysis" by Verity et al. https://doi.org/10.1016/S1473-3099(20)30243-7.
